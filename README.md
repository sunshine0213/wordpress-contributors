# WordPress Contributors Plugin :electric_plug:
> * This plugin allows you to add more than one author for the post in the Add New and Edit Post section of WordPress dashboard.
> * The plugin would display a section called 'Contributors' below each post in the front end of your site, which will contain the list of authors for that post selected from WordPress dashboard. 
> * Please Note that the initial author of the post will always be selected.
